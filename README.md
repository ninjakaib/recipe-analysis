# Savory Statistics
An exploration of a dataset of recipes and reviews


## Introduction
Welcome to my data analysis project! In this analysis, I will be exploring a large dataset of recipes and their corresponding reviews. This dataset is comprehensive and contains 234,429 rows, each representing a unique recipe-review pair. 

The primary question driving this analysis is: **What variables have the greatest effect on the rating of a recipe?** This question is of interest not just for amateur and professional chefs looking to create popular recipes, but also for anyone who enjoys cooking or eating - which is to say, practically everyone. By understanding what factors contribute to a higher rating, we can all learn how to better select and improve recipes based on our own tastes and the shared wisdom of the review community.

The relevant columns in the dataset for this analysis are:

- `id`: The unique identifier for each recipe.
- `minutes`: The total time it takes to prepare the recipe.
- `tags`: A list of tags associated with the recipe.
- `n_steps`: The number of steps involved in making the recipe.
- `n_ingredients`: The number of ingredients required by the recipe.
- `ingredients`: A list of the recipe's ingredients.
- `date`: The date the recipe was submitted.
- `rating`: The rating given by the reviewer, on a scale from 1 to 5.
- `rating_mean`: The average rating of all reviews for the recipe.
- `nutrition`: Nutritional information about the recipe, including calories, fat, sugar, sodium, protein, saturated fat, and carbohydrates.

Join me as I delve into this dataset to uncover what makes a recipe truly great!

## Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

### Data Cleaning
I began by cleaning the data...

### Univariate Analysis
To get an idea of the distribution of individual variables...

Here are some of the key findings:

### Bivariate Analysis
I then looked at the relationship between different pairs of variables...

Here are some of the key findings:

### Interesting Aggregates
I found some interesting aggregates...

## Assessment of Missingness

### NMAR Analysis
I performed an analysis to determine whether the data is Not Missing At Random (NMAR)...

### Missingness Dependency
Then, I checked whether missingness in some variables depends on others...

## Hypothesis Testing
Finally, I conducted hypothesis tests to answer some of the main questions about this data...
